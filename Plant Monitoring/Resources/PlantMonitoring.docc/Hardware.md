# Hardware

This article explains the details about the device that is used to monitor plants.

## Overview

The plant monitoring device is equipped with several sensors to measure critical environmental factors, ensuring optimal plant health. The device records:

- `Humidity: Measures the moisture level in the plant’s soil.
- `Light Level`: Tracks the intensity of light, ensuring plants receive adequate lighting.
- `Temperature`: Monitors the ambient temperature in the plant’s environment.

## API Interaction

The ESP32 module interacts directly with the **Plant Monitoring API** to upload data such as temperature, humidity, and light levels. This data can be accessed remotely by users via the Plant Monitoring mobile application.

For more information on how to access and interact with the API, refer to the [API section](#API) of the documentation.
